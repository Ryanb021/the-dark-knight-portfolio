      "description": "My name is Ryan Bagan and I am a Software Developer. I am a US NAVY Veteran and my previous experiences besides my military background includes Naval Force Protection Security with knowledge of armed response, anti-terrorism, combat arms, and I was also a radio jockey. I decided to become a Software Developer as I believe the future is here. I also wanted to make a difference and have a very meaningful career. Learning skills in JavaScript, HTML, CSS brought out my personality and enabled me to express myself on websites that I have created. It also made me feel that I stood out from the crowd, helped me understand and explore other programming languages, and contribute to projects better. I believe that my previous experience with teamwork, leadership, mentorship, large scale operations management, my commitment to deadlines, attention to detail, and work ethic is of great value and advantage that I can bring to my next company and my next job. Thank you very much and looking forward to being a part of your team.üëç",
